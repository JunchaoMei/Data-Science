Time consumed to finish running my codes: about 1 hour.
This may caused by the character-based file-reading method used in my scripts instead of line-based file-reading.

And I feel very sorry for the late submission, this course is pretty hard for non-IS-major students like me.
But I will definitely try my best to improve algorithms for the rest of our assignments.

My code is able to generate the results.
